# Raytracer

A simple raytracer built with haskell.

ðŸ”´ NOT WORKING YET!

## Usage

Use the raytracer like this:

```
cabal run raytracer res_width res_height
```

So for example (for a 1920x1080 image):

```
cabal run raytracer 1920 1080
```

## Progress

In this chapter, I will track the progress of the raytracer everytime I continue the work on it. I will explain why certain things are done and the technical/mathematical explanations (oversimplified) too.

### Creating an image

When we want to build a raytracer, the first thing we need is to create an image. A simple image format to create is the [ppm image format](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Anymap).

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="docs/ppm_example.png" alt="PPM Image Example" style="width: 70%" />
</div>


We can use that to create a simple picture using some code:

```haskell
type Pixel = (Int, Int, Int)   -- (R,G,B)
type Row = [Pixel]
type Image = [Row]

createPPM :: Int -> Int -> Image
createPPM width height =
    [[(r, g, b) | x <- [0..width-1],
                  let r = scale x width,
                  let g = 0,
                  let b = scale y height]
                | y <- [0..height-1]]
    where
        scale val maxVal = round (((255.999 :: Double) * fromIntegral val) / fromIntegral (maxVal - 1))
```

This functions creates a picture based on a given width and height, creating a gradient from bottom left (blue) to top right (red), which looks like this:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="docs/first_generated_images.png" alt="First generated image in the PPM format" style="width: 70%" />
</div>

This image has been created 1920x1080. I allow the user to choose a resolution by providing arguments to the raytracer:

```
cabal run raytracer 1920 1080
```

You can see this in the code in the `Main.hs`

```haskell
import ImageGenerator as IG -- ImageGenerator is an own module in this repository

main = do
    args <- getArgs -- Retrieve command-line args
    let (width, height) = parseArgs args -- parse them
    ...
    IG.createAndWriteFile filename $ IG.ppmToStr $ IG.createPPM width height
```

### Creating the Progress Bar

When building a computationally intense application like a raytracer, we excpect longer computation times. It can take forever to render complex scenes. That's why we're adding a progress bar. It gives us a clear sense that things are moving along, helps you catch if something's stuck and shows performance stats so you can see the effect of optimizations.

#### Setting Up the Progress Bar

```haskell
newProgressBar :: Int -> IO ProgressBar
newProgressBar total = do
    progressRef     <- newIORef 0.0
    messageRef      <- newIORef ""
    startTimeRef    <- newIORef =<< getMonotonicTime
    currentStepsRef <- newIORef 0
    totalStepsRef   <- newIORef total
    return $ ProgressBar progressRef messageRef startTimeRef currentStepsRef totalStepsRef
```

We need this function to set up everything for the progress bar. It tracks:

- How much progress we've made
- The total number of steps (e.g. how many rays or pixels we're calculating)
- The time we started, so we know how long we're computing.

#### Updating Progress

```haskell
updateProgress :: ProgressBar -> Int -> IO ()
updateProgress pb steps = do
    writeIORef (currentSteps pb) steps
    total <- readIORef (totalSteps pb)
    writeIORef (progress pb) (fromIntegral steps / fromIntegral total)
    renderProgressBar pb
```

Updating the progress as the raytracer does its thing. Every time certain number of steps are completed, we update how many steps are done, we calculate how for along we are (percentage) and we refresh the progress bar on the screen.

#### Rendering the bar

```haskell
renderProgressBar :: ProgressBar -> IO ()
renderProgressBar pb = do
    ... -- Read IORefs to grab progress, message, etc.
    let filled = replicate (progressPercent * 50 `div` 100) 'â–“'
    let empty = replicate (50 - length filled) 'â–‘'
    putStr $ "\r[" ++ filled ++ empty ++ "] " ++ show progressPercent ++ "% ..."
    hFlush stdout
```

This is where the magic happens: it takes all the data - like how for along we are, how fast it's going and how long it's been running - and renders it as a nice progress bar. We use `â–“` for the filled part and `â–‘` for the empty part, so it looks slick.

Here is a screenshot of what the bar looks like when we start the raytracer:

Here is a screenshot of what the bar looks like when it's about 3/4 done.:

![Middle Progress Bar](./docs/pb_middle.png)

And here is what it looks when the program ended:

### Vectors - The Vec3 module

The `Vec3` module is the backbone of all the 3D math we'll need in our ray tracer. It handles everything from points in space to directions, colors, and even lighting calculations.

A `Vec3` is a 3D vector with three components: `x`, `y` and `z`. It's used for points, directions and colors (RGB values for pixels). We need a bunch of vector math for a ray tracer which include:

- Addition, subtraction, scaling, dot product, cross product
- Turning any vector into a unit vector (length = 1)
- Multiplying or dividing vectors component by component (useful for colors).

Example usage of `Vec3`:

```haskell
origin :: Vec3
origin = Vec3 0 0 0

direction :: Vec3
direction = Vec3 1 2 3

rayAt :: Vec3 -> Vec3 -> Double -> Vec3
rayAt origin direction t = add origin (scale t direction)

pixelColor :: Vec3
pixelColor = normalize (Vec3 0.5 0.7 1.0)
```

You can check out the `Vec3` implementation [here](./app/Vec3.hs).

### ImageGenerator Module - Drawing circles

Later we will want to create a sphere. So lets start by doing it in 2D by changing the `createPPM`
to not do a fade, but draw a circle:

```haskell
createPPM :: Int -> Int -> Image
createPPM width height =
    [[pixelColor i j | i <- [0..width-1]] | j <- [0..height-1]]
    where
        cx = width `div` 2
        cy = height `div` 2
        radius = min cx cy `div` 2
        pixelColor i j =
            if (i - cx) ^ (2 :: Integer) + (j - cy) ^ (2 :: Integer) <= radius ^ (2 :: Integer)
                then Vec3 1.0 0.0 0.0 -- Red
                else Vec3 1.0 1.0 1.0 -- White
```

As you see, we here already use `Vec3` for the colors. Colors often require operations like addition, scaling and blending.
Since `Vec3` already supports these operations, and colors can be represented by three components, it simplifies the implementation.

With that, we can create this image with a red circle:

![Red Circle](./docs/red_circle.png)

### The Ray Module

The `Ray` module defines a `Ray` type and provides utility functions for working with rays.

A `Ray` type is defined by its origin (a point in 3D space) and its direction (a 3D vector). Both are represented using the `Vec3` type.

```haskell
data Ray = Ray
    { origin :: Vec3
    , direction :: Vec3
    } deriving (Show)
```

The `at` function computes the point at parameter `t` along the ray.

```haskell
at :: Ray -> Double -> Vec3
at (Ray orig dir) t = orig `add` scale t dir
```

We can us it infix to improve readability. Example Usage:

```haskell
-- Define a ray
let rayOrigin = Vec3 1.0 2.0 3.0
let rayDirection = Vec3 0.0 1.0 0.0
let ray = Ray rayOrigin rayDirection

-- Compute the point at t = 2.0 using infix notation
let pointAtT = ray `at` 2.0
```

### Start the Raytracing

A ray tracer sends rays through pixels and computes the color seen in the direction of those rays. The steps are:

1. Calculate the ray from the "eye" through the pixel
2. Determine which objects the ray hits
3. Compute a color for the closest intersection point.

To start that, we need a camera in the scene.

We'll define a standard camera which works with an aspect ratio of 16:9

```haskell
defaultCamera :: Int -> Int -> Camera
defaultCamera width height =
    let aspectRatio = fromIntegral width / fromIntegral height
        viewportHeight = 2.0
        viewportWidth = viewportHeight * aspectRatio

        focalLength = 1.0

        origin = V.Vec3 0.0 0.0 0.0
        horizontal = V.Vec3 viewportWidth 0.0 0.0
        vertical = V.Vec3 0.0 viewportHeight 0.0
        lowerLeftCorner = origin `V.sub` V.scale 0.5 horizontal
                                `V.sub` V.scale 0.5 vertical
                                `V.sub` V.Vec3 0.0 0.0 focalLength
    in Camera origin lowerLeftCorner horizontal vertical
```

This camera is set to the center (0/0/0).

We're here creating a background for the scene later by changing the image generation again:

### Adding a Sphere

The equation for a sphere of radius r that is centered at the origin is:

$$
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2
$$

If we allow the sphere to be at an arbitrary point ($C_x,C_y,C_z$), then the equation looks like this:

$$
(C_x - x)^2 + (C_y - y)^2 + (C_z - z)^2 = r^2
$$

In graphics, you want your formulas to be in terms of vectors, so that we can simply represent coordinates
using `Vec3`.

If we rewrite the equation of the sphere in vector form, we get:

$$
(C - P) \cdot (C - P) = r^2
$$

We can read this as "any point P that satisfies this equation is on the sphere". We want to know
if our ray $P(t) = Q + td$ ever hits the sphere anywhere. If it does hit the sphere, there is some
$t$ for which $P(t)$ satisfies the sphere equation. So we are looking for any $t$ where this is true:

$$
(C-P(t)) \cdot (C-P(t)) = r^2
$$

which can be found by replacing $P(t)$ with its expanded form:

$$
(C - (Q + td)) \cdot (C - (Q + td)) = r^2
$$

We have three vectors on the left dotted by three vectors on the right. If we solved for the full dot product
we would get nine vectors. You can definitely go through and write everything out, but we don't need to work
that hard. If you remember, we want to solve for t, so we'll separate the terms based on whether there is
a t or not:

$$
(-td + (C - Q)) \cdot (-td + (C - Q)) = r^2
$$

And now we follow the rules of vector algebra to distribute the dot product:

$$
t^2d \cdot d - 2td \cdot (C - Q) + (C - Q) \cdot (C - Q) = r^2
$$

Now we move the radius squared to the left side:

$$
t^2d \cdot d - 2td \cdot (C - Q) + (C - Q) \cdot (C - Q) - r^2 = 0
$$

The vectors and $r$ in that equation are all constant and known. Furthermore, the only vectors that we
have are reduced to scalars by dot product. The only unknown is t, and we have $t^2$, which means that
this equation is quadratic. You can solve for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ by using the
quadratic formula:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Solving for t in the ray-sphere intersection equation gives us these values for a, b and c:

$$
a = d \cdot d \\
b = -2d \cdot (C - Q) \\
c = (C - Q) \cdot (C - Q) - r^2
$$

Using all of the above you can solve for t, but there is a square root part that can be either positive
(meaning two real solutions), negative (meaning no real solutions), or zero (meaning one real solution).
In graphics, the algebra almost always relates very directly to the geometry.

If we use that we can hardcore detection for a sphere into our raytracer:
