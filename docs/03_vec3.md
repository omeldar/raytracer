# Chapter 3: Vectors - The Vec3 Module

The `Vec3` module is the backbone of all the 3D math we'll need in our ray tracer. It handles everything from points in space to directions, colors, and even lighting calculations.

A `Vec3` is a 3D vector with three components: `x`, `y` and `z`. We use this single type for points, directions, and RGB color values. Since all of these are conceptually just 3D vectors, having a unified representation keeps the math clean and consistent.

We need a variety of operations for ray tracing: vector addition and subtraction, scaling, dot product, and cross product. We'll also need to turn any vector into a unit vector (length = 1), and sometimes multiply or divide vectors component-wise ‚Äî especially useful when dealing with color blending or attenuation.

Here‚Äôs a small example showing how `Vec3` is used in different contexts:

```haskell
origin :: Vec3
origin = Vec3 0 0 0

direction :: Vec3
direction = Vec3 1 2 3

rayAt :: Vec3 -> Vec3 -> Double -> Vec3
rayAt origin direction t = add origin (scale t direction)

pixelColor :: Vec3
pixelColor = normalize (Vec3 0.5 0.7 1.0)
```

You can check out the full `Vec3` implementation [here](/app/Core/Vec3.hs).
