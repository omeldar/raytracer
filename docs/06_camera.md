# Chapter 6: Adding a Camera

A ray tracer sends rays through pixels and computes the color seen in the direction of those rays. The general idea is simple:

1. Calculate the ray from the \"eye\" through the pixel
2. Determine which object(s) the ray hits
3. Compute the color at the closest intersection point

To start that, we need a camera in the scene. We'll define a standard camera positioned at `(0, 0, 0)` and then cast rays through a virtual viewport in front of it. Later on, we‚Äôll experiment with moving the camera and observing the effect on the scene.

Here‚Äôs how we define a basic camera:

```haskell
defaultCamera :: Int -> Int -> Camera
defaultCamera width height =
    let aspectRatio = fromIntegral width / fromIntegral height
        viewportHeight = 2.0
        viewportWidth = viewportHeight * aspectRatio

        focalLength = 1.0

        origin = V.Vec3 0.0 0.0 0.0
        horizontal = V.Vec3 viewportWidth 0.0 0.0
        vertical = V.Vec3 0.0 viewportHeight 0.0
        lowerLeftCorner = origin `V.sub` V.scale 0.5 horizontal
                                `V.sub` V.scale 0.5 vertical
                                `V.sub` V.Vec3 0.0 0.0 focalLength
    in Camera origin lowerLeftCorner horizontal vertical
```

This defines a viewport (or screen) in front of the camera. The camera sits at the origin, and the lower-left corner of the screen is calculated by stepping back in the X and Y directions by half the screen‚Äôs width and height, and then stepping forward in Z by the focal length.

Before we add any objects like spheres, we update the background first ‚Äî getting rid of the circle we rendered earlier. This means changing our traceRay function so it produces a vertical gradient instead of solid color.

```haskell
traceRay :: R.Ray -> Col.Color
traceRay ray =
    let V.Vec3 _ y _ = V.normalize (R.direction ray)  -- Normalize direction
        t = 0.5 * (y + 1.0)
        white = V.Vec3 1.0 1.0 1.0
        blue  = V.Vec3 0.5 0.7 1.0
    in Col.lerp t white blue  -- Use lerp for smooth background

```

This produces a smooth vertical blend from white (at the top of the image) to blue (at the bottom), creating the look of a basic sky gradient.

Here's the resulting image:

With this, we've taken a big step forward tracing rays through a scene: the camera is generating rays ocrrectly, and we're producing a gradient background based on the ray direction. The next step is to let rays interact with geometry.
